If you are migrating to `rive-react-native` note the following changes below.

## Breaking API Changes 

### Ref API 

- `.play()` - Invoking the `.play()` API on the Rive `ref`
  - `animationNames: [String]` -&gt; `animationName: String`
    - To play a singular linear animation, use the `animationName` property
    - To play (and mix) multiple linear animations together, you will have to do this via a state machine and pass in `true` for the `isStateMachine` flag in this `.play()` API
- `.pause()` - Invoking the `.pause()` API on the Rive `ref`
  - This API no longer requires passing any arguments to invoke, as it will pause a singular playing animation or state machine
- `.stop()` - Invoking the `.stop()` API on the Rive `ref`
  - This API no longer requires passing any arguments to invoke, as it will stop a singular playing animation or state machine

### General Usage

- When rendering the `<Rive>` component, we **highly** recommend specifying either an `animationName` or `stateMachineName` prop explicitly, otherwise, if you do not provide either of these props:
  - `iOS` may play the first state machine it finds in the Artboard as a default
  - `Android` may play the first linear animation it finds in the Artboard as a default

<Note>
 **Note, the default behavior will change in a next major release, whereby the default play will be a state machine**
</Note>
### React Native 

- Bumping the `react-native` dependency from `v0.63.4` to `v0.65.0`
- Bumping the `react` dependency from `16.13.1` to `v17.0.2`

### Android

- Bumping the Kotlin version from `1.5.20` to `1.7.10`

<Note>
 **If you intend to run Rive on Android devices, please update to** `4.0.1` **at the least, which includes a crucial bug fix on the render lifecycle**
