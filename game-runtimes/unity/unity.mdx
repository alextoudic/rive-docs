<Note>
 The Rive Unity runtime is currently in **Technical Preview** for Mac and Windows installs of Unity. We're hoping to gather feedback about the API and feature-set as we expand platform support. Please reach out to us on our [Forum](https://rive.app/community/forums/home) or through our [Support Channel](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).

### Bug Reports

If you encounter any errors or unexpected crashes while integrating the Rive Unity runtime, we recommend logging a detailed issue directly to the [rive-unity](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity/issues) repo with an **Editor.log** attached to the issue to help provide more details and context about what might have occurred.

You can find more details on where to find your Editor.log file in the [Unity docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html).

<Note>
 Note that it is best to grab the Editor.log file immediately after a crash has occurred
