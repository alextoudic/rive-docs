Scrolling comes to Rive in the form of two new constraints; one to add touch-based scrolling to overflowed content, and another to create a scroll bar. Both constraints work in conjunction with the existing layout components. We plan to provide generalised scrolling components for quicker setup in future.

<Note>Heads up: Scroll wheel/trackpad gestures aren't supported yet. We prioritized releasing this feature now to enhance our layout engine. A revamped input system in 2025 will support gestures, key presses, game controllers, and more!</Note>

## Content Scrolling

To add scrolling to a Layout Component, select the Layout Component that defines the content region to be scrolled, use the add action within the constraint inspector to add a scroll content constraint.

Once added, use the options fly-out to adjust the scroll direction and physics.

Switch to animate mode and start playback of a State Machine to preview the applied scroll constraint.

## Creating a Scroll Bar

To create a scroll bar, select a Layout Component acting as the scroll bar thumb. From the constraints inspector, add a Scroll Bar Thumb constraint.
