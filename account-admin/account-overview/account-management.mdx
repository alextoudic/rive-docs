How do I find my account settings and billing information and manage my workspace?

On the [Rive website](https://rive.app/), in the upper right is a button that says "Get Started."

Click the "Get Started" button to launch the Rive web application. Note: If you aren't logged in, it will prompt you to log in.

Your name and the word "drafts" are at the top of the page. Click on the drop-down arrow, then click on Manage Account. This opens your [account information](https://rive.app/account/?section=account) in a new tab.

**Notifications**: This is where any notifications you have will appear.

#### Share links: 

This tab shows you any share links you have generated. You can see the file you shared, the date when the share link was created, if the share link is active, and the link to the file. By toggling the Active button off, the link becomes inactive. You can also copy the link and share it as long as it's active.

Each workspace has a name, and under the name is the status of the workspace.

- Active: The workspace is active and paid.
- Active (ends on a specific date): This workspace is set to cancel at the end of the billing cycle.
- Suspended: The workspace is canceled.
- Failed Payment: The payment failed, and the workspace is canceled.

To manage the workspace, click "Manage Workspace" to the right.

#### Plan: 

This tells you the name of the plan the workspace is on and the status of the workspace.

**Profile:** This shows the information about the workspace. You can update this by clicking "Edit Profile".

**Manage Billing**: This link takes you to a Stripe page. You can update your billing information, change your payment method, and add a VAT number if necessary.

**Members**: If you are part of a paid workspace, you can view your workspace members here. You will see who the workspace owner (yourself) is, and any other workspace members will be listed. Clicking on "Invite Members" will allow you to type in an email address. Once you hit enter, the email address is shown below, and you can click on the box to make that person an admin. You will be given information on what adding that person will cost and your next billing. They are not invited to the workspace until you click the "Confirm & Pay" button. Once you confirm the change, an invite to the workspace will be emailed out, and you will be charged for adding the new person to your workspace.

If you aren't logged in, you must enter the email address associated with your Rive account. Stripe will email you a login link.
