The link in the email no longer works. How can I download my receipts?

You must log in to your account and access your account admin page: [rive.app/accountâ€‹](https://rive.app/account/)

Under "Workspaces" is the list of workspaces you are part of. Locate the workspace you wish to download the receipt for and click on "Manage Plan."

On the workspaces management page, scroll down to "Billing."

Click on the "Manage Billing" link on the right.

You will be directed to a secure Stripe page. At the bottom of the Stripe page is your Invoice History for this workspace. Clicking on the date for each invoice will open the invoice for you in a different window. You can then download a PDF version of your receipt and/or your invoice.
