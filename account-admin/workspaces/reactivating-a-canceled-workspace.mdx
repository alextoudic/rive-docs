title: 'Reactivating a Canceled Workspace'
description: ''

<Warning>
If you mistakenly create a NEW workspace instead of reactivating an existing workspace, contact us at [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) and we can help you cancel the incorrect workspace. 

We cannot move payments from one workspace to another workspace. We can only cancel the wrong workspace and refund you. 

We cannot move files from one workspace to another for you. If you have files saved in the wrong workspace, please download your backup files (.rev files) BEFORE canceling your workspace. To generate a backup file, right-click on the file and select "Download backup." This generates a .rev file, which is a complete backup of your file.
</Warning>

To reactivate the correct workspace, you will need to go to your account page: [https://rive.app/account/](https://rive.app/account/)

Partway down the page, you will see a section labeled “Workspaces.”

To the right of each workspace is a link that says “Manage Workspace.” If you select the link on the left that says “Create new Workspace,” you will create a **NEW** workspace and not upgrade an existing workspace. 

<Info>You can own and be a member of multiple workspaces.</Info> 

Its status is under each workspace name. A green Active status means this workspace is active. A red Suspended status means this workspace is canceled. 

Click “Manage Workspace.” Each workspace has a display name and a username, which you can change.

If you have multiple workspaces with the same display name, check the username to see which one you want to reactivate. If you are uncertain which workspace you want to reactivate, contact us at [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) and we can help you locate the correct workspace.

If you only have one workspace, then that is the workspace you want to reactivate. 

Two links, "Reactivate Plan" and "Delete Workspace," are to the right in the Plan section.

Click "Reactivate Plan."

Now you are on the reactivation page. You can see the billing if you choose a yearly plan (paid upfront for the year) or a monthly plan (paid every month). Whichever billing you select, you are given the total cost before you finalize the purchase.
