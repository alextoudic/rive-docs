## Free Workspace

Create a workspace for free and invite an unlimited number of workspace members. [Free plan limits](/account-admin/pricing#individual-free-plan) still apply.

There is a button in the editor to create a new workspace.

If you accidentally type in an incorrect email address or add someone you do not want to include, you can remove them before creating the workspace. Once you are ready, click on "Create Workspace." Invitations to the workspace will be sent via email to each person you added as soon as the workspace is created.

<Info>
  If you have multiple Rive accounts with different email addresses (e.g., a work email address account and a personal email address account), log out of Rive BEFORE accepting the invite. Regardless of the email address the invite was emailed to, clicking to accept the invite will connect to the Rive account you are currently logged into.
